# WebRTC and Socket.IO

# WebRTC:
Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) is a technology that enables real-time communication between browsers.
Learn more about how WebRTC powers VidConnect by exploring the [WebRTC Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)

# Socket.IO:
Socket.IO is a real-time communication library that enables bidirectional communication between clients and servers. 
Understand how Socket.IO enhances VidConnect's real-time capabilities by referring to the [Socket.IO Documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v3)
